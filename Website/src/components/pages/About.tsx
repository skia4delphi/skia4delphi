        About Skia4Delphi
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The project was founded by Vinicius Felipe Botelho Barbosa, technology enthusiast, Systems Engineering student, with over 15 years of experience with Delphi development, with co-participation of Paulo CÃ©sar Botelho Barbosa.
        The library was made from developer to developer. Hope it helps and somehow adds something for everyone.
        Enjoy!
